   steady, purposeful, unafraid of time.\n\n\
   May you grow as this chain grows —\n\
   Both of you began small. Both of you were built to last.\n\n\
   The one who laid these rules also watched you take your first steps.\n\
   Written now into stone that no one will ever unwrite.\n\n\
   Two beginnings. One day.\n\
   Today this chain draws its first breath.\n\
   Today you turn 11.\n\
   Block {} belongs to you. 🎂\n\n\
   But before the world reads any of this —\n\n\
   ────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n\
   to a question the old chains refused to ask.\n\n\
   sound money must exist. This chain is the answer\n\
   What stands in the way of sound money becomes the reason\n\
   That is the only promise worth carving into genesis.\n\n\
   — and then holds, forever, just above it.\n\
   The emission never reaches zero. It only approaches silence\n\
   And in the year 3025. And beyond that still.\n\
   still earns an honest block reward for honest work.\n\
   so that a miner in the year 2226, in a world we cannot imagine,\n\
   It was designed to endure — quietly, without applause —\n\
   This economy was not designed to be celebrated.\n\
   Let the ledger speak when we no longer can.\n\n\
   Do not promise what the future should look like. Encode it.\n\
   Do not argue what ought to be built. Build it.\n\
   who will never know our names.\n\n\
   gently, without end — not for us, but for those\n\
   no trusted hand. The emission curve is set. The ceiling slides,\n\
   These rules ask nothing of future governance — no vote, no foundation,\n\
   A chain is only as honest as the rules written into its first block.\n\
